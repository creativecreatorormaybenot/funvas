## 0.1.0-nullsafety.2

* Moved package location (adjusted homepage).
* Moved tweets out of the example package.

## 0.1.0-nullsafety.1

* Removed `flutter` SDK version constraint for PANA.

## 0.1.0-nullsafety.0

* Added breaking change version.
  Of course, this is somewhat pointless now that the breaking change is already available
  as `0.0.4`, however, we should be fine by not publishing that as a pre-release. And this is
  especially fine as the migration was meant to be a demonstration :)

## 0.0.4-nullsafety.3

* Ran `dart format` to format all files.

## 0.0.4-nullsafety.2

* Fixed changelog.

## 0.0.4-nullsafety.1

* Migrated to null safety.

## 0.0.3+1

* Removed unnecessary publish workflow badge from README.

## 0.0.3

* Included example GIFs in the README.
* Added gifsicle optimization in exporter.
* Improved package description.

## 0.0.2

* Expanded example by adding funvas animations and an exporter for exporting funvas animations to
  GIF.
* Updated README to include usage guide and mention the exporter.

## 0.0.1

* Pre-release version of funvas that is a functioning package but not yet polished.
